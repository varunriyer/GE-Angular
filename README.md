# JavaScript and Git Programming

## Overview

This sprint is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of core JavaScript programming features and essential Git version control workflows. It equips learners with the foundational knowledge needed to write efficient JavaScript code and manage collaborative projects using Git.

## Topics Covered

### JavaScript Programming

- **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)**  
  Provides an interactive environment for learning JavaScript by executing code snippets directly in the console or terminal.

- **Basic Programming Constructs**  
  Covers variables, conditionals (if-else), loops (for, while), and basic input/output, enabling the creation of dynamic logic and flow control.

- **Methods of Primitives**  
  Introduces methods available on primitive types such as strings, numbers, and booleans, emphasizing how JavaScript treats primitives as objects.

- **Numbers and Number Operations**  
  Focuses on performing mathematical operations, working with floating-point precision, and understanding special numeric values like NaN and Infinity.

- **Strings and String Manipulation**  
  Teaches string operations such as concatenation, slicing, searching, and template literals for building dynamic strings.

- **Arrays and Common Array Methods**  
  Explores array creation, indexing, and transformation using key methods:
  - `forEach`: Executes a function on each element.
  - `filter`: Returns a new array with elements that meet a condition.
  - `map`: Creates a new array with transformed elements.
  - `reduce`: Applies a function against an accumulator to reduce the array to a single value.

- **Arrow Functions**  
  Introduces concise function syntax, especially useful for writing short callback functions, with an understanding of lexical `this` binding.

- **Iterables**  
  Discusses iterable objects and how they work with `for...of` loops, including strings, arrays, and custom iterable objects.

- **Map and Set**  
  Teaches the use of `Map` for key-value pairs and `Set` for storing unique values, offering more flexibility than plain objects and arrays.

- **WeakMap and WeakSet**  
  Explains collections that allow garbage-collected keys, useful in managing memory and avoiding memory leaks.

- **Destructuring Assignment**  
  Provides a clean and readable syntax to extract values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

- **Variable Declarations and Scope**  
  Highlights differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`, scope rules, hoisting, and best practices for declaring variables.

### Git Programming

- **Branching Strategies**  
  Demonstrates creating and switching branches for feature development, enabling parallel workflows.

- **Merging Techniques**  
  Covers merging branches and resolving merge conflicts to integrate changes efficiently.

- **Commit Management**  
  Encourages meaningful commit messages and effective commit history practices for clear project documentation.

- **Conflict Resolution**  
  Offers strategies to detect, understand, and resolve code conflicts that arise during collaborative development.

- **Feature and Version Management**  
  Explains how to manage multiple versions of a project and track development progress through branching and tagging.

- **Pull Request (PR) Workflow**  
  Introduces code review processes using pull requests, including creating, reviewing, and merging PRs on GitHub or similar platforms.

- **Using GitBash as a Client Tool**  
  Teaches how to use GitBash to perform Git operations from the command line, enhancing developer efficiency and control.
